The  enclosed files,  plfann.h,  plfann.c  and  plfann.pl  form  the  SWI-Prolog
bindings to  the Fast Artificial  Neural Network library. fann is an open source 
ANN-library and is released under the LGPL. The version of the library for which
these bindings are intended to be used with is version 2.1.0. Functions foreseen
in version 2.2.0 are equally included, but have been commented out.

On the  fann home page, links  are provided to  the Source  Code, the  Reference 
Manual and additionally, more general, materials related to ANN's.

All available functions are implemented, with the exception of:

     1. fann_create_train_from_callback
     2. fann_set_callback
     
The  predicate names, used in  this library,  are the  same as the  ones in  the 
reference manual. C-Function return arguments  are added  as an additional  (and
last) argument  to the  predicates concerned.  In a small  number of  functions, 
having length values, like  f.e. the length of  an input array, these  arguments
have been removed, as these can be obtained in the prolog interface at relative-
ly low cost.
